##  Docker(Production) ‚ú≥Ô∏è :eight_spoked_asterisk:  
So, the server is running on a linux os, and containerized with docker.  
The following steps needs to be taken  

* Run a ```$ ls -al``` command to see if _run_docker.sh_ is available in the projests' parent directory

* Edit _run_docker.sh_ with the _nano_ command by inputting your desired name and port number in variables **IMAGENAME** and **Port**
```$ nano run_docker.sh```

* Make run_docker.sh an executable
``$ chmod +x run_docker.sh`` which is in the project home directory

* Edit your Nginx conf to proxy off **localhost:PORT** in _location_ block where 
**PORT** (e.g 3000) is nodejs system default programmed port as found in the ```config.js``` file
    ```
     location / {
                    proxy_pass http://localhost:Port;
            }
    ```

* Execute the _run_doker.sh_ file
```$ ./run_docker.sh```
